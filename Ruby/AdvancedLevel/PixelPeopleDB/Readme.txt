Objective: 

A fast prototype to use as a resource in a small iOS game. The
Game consists of trying to make genetic combinations of professions
to get all 150 professions.
The prototype consists in finding out where certain professions
come from in order for the user to figure out what professions 
he/she must create to get the goal profession

In the long run I may implement a GUI for this and 
Put it on the web for people to use.
