ScrabbleSolver Personal Project from Kocsen Chung

Date Started:	JAN2012
Date Ended:		JAN2012
Status:			Frozen


History:
	This project was meant to teach myself Ruby and a little of how it works
	while being a part of a bigger project to build a multi platform scrabble
		game.

Functionality:
	Actual:
		Organizes a dictionary.txt file into a large hash whos key is the sorted
		word, and whos value is the owrd itself in order to find all possible words given a set of letters.
		Will also find the number of points (int) for a word.

	Expected:
		Parse an active scrabble board and find the best possible move
		given the tiles of one player. It should account for bonuses (ie. double
		points for letter, or double point for word etc.)

		IN>	Tiles in hand
		OUT>Best possible move
