Objective: Use C to read in from STDIN and count each occurence of the alphabetical
			letters. Once counted, the letter counts are calibrated to make the maximum
			count = 70 and scale the rest, to then print out a visual histrogram (on CL)
			for each letter count.

To run:
	$ ./histogram < FileNameToRead
